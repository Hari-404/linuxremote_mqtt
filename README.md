# Linux Remote Control with MQTT

This project explores the possibility of controlling the computer remotely using an Android phone device. The proposed prototype is able to control a lot of operations a normal computer keyboard and mouse would perform. It practically turns a mobile phone into a wireless keyboard and mouse using a wireless network via a portable mobile device running under an Android Operating System. It helps mobile phone users on facilitating their work in study life, home life or working life, where the use of the prototype helps in easing the device control.

MQTT protocal is used for communication between PC and Android mobile.
